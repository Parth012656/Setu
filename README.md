## Key Features

The system provides the following core capabilities:

1. **A payment can travel from sender to backend through untrusted intermediaries** without any of them being able to read or tamper with it. (Hybrid RSA + AES-GCM encryption.)
2. **Even if the same payment reaches the backend simultaneously through multiple bridge nodes, it settles exactly once.** (Idempotency via atomic compare-and-set on the ciphertext hash.)
3. **A tampered or replayed packet is rejected** before it touches the ledger.

These capabilities collectively ensure secure and reliable transaction processing across the mesh network.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 17 or newer** installed and on PATH (or `JAVA_HOME` set). Check with `java -version`.
- That's it. No database, no Redis, no Maven (the wrapper handles it). Just Java.

### Run on Windows

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```cmd
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

The first run downloads Maven (~10 MB) and all dependencies (~80 MB) — give it a couple of minutes. Subsequent runs start in a few seconds.

### Run on Mac/Linux

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Open the dashboard

Once you see `Started UpiMeshApplication in X.XXX seconds`, open:

**http://localhost:8080**


### Stop the server

`Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### Run the tests

```cmd
mvnw.cmd test
```

The primary concurrency validation test is `IdempotencyConcurrencyTest`.

## Transaction Processing Workflow

The following workflow describes how a transaction propagates through the mesh network and reaches the settlement service.

### Step 1 — Compose a payment

Choose sender, receiver, amount, PIN. Click **"📤 Inject into Mesh"**.

**What actually happens on the backend:**
- The server simulates sender-side packet generation.
- It builds a `PaymentInstruction` with a unique nonce and current timestamp.
- It encrypts that with the server's RSA public key (using hybrid encryption — see below).
- It wraps the ciphertext in a `MeshPacket` with a TTL of 5.
- It hands the packet to `phone-alice`, an offline virtual device.

The packet is now available for propagation across the mesh network.

### Step 2 — Run gossip rounds

Click **"🔄 Run Gossip Round"**. Then click it again.

Each round, every device that holds a packet broadcasts it to every other device within "Bluetooth range" (which, in the current implementation, includes all virtual devices). TTL decrements per hop.

After 1 round: every device holds the packet. After 2 rounds: still every device — TTL is just lower.

In the real system this would happen organically as people walk past each other in the basement.

### Step 3 — Bridge Node Upload and Settlement

Click **"📡 Bridges Upload to Backend"**.

`phone-bridge` is the only device with `hasInternet=true`. The bridge node uploads queued packets once connectivity becomes available. It POSTs every packet it holds to `/api/bridge/ingest`.

The backend pipeline runs:
1. Hash the ciphertext (`SHA-256`).
2. Try to claim the hash in the idempotency cache.
3. If claimed: decrypt with the server's RSA private key.
4. Verify freshness (signedAt within 24 hours).
5. Run the debit/credit in a single DB transaction.

Watch the **Account Balances** table — money has moved. Watch the **Transaction Ledger** — a new row appears.

### Step 4 — Transaction Deduplication and Settlement

Reset the mesh. Inject a single packet. Run gossip 2 times. Now **all 5 devices hold the same packet, including multiple bridges in a more complex setup**.

The architecture supports concurrent packet delivery while guaranteeing exactly-once settlement.

1. Click "Inject" once.
2. Click "Gossip" twice.
3. Click "Flush Bridges" — only `phone-bridge` is a bridge in the default seed, so just one upload happens.

To exercise the *concurrent duplicate* case properly, run the test:
```cmd
mvnw.cmd test -Dtest=IdempotencyConcurrencyTest#singlePacketDeliveredByThreeBridgesSettlesExactlyOnce
```

This test creates one packet, fires 3 threads at `BridgeIngestionService.ingest()` simultaneously, and verifies that exactly one settles, two are dropped as duplicates, and the sender is debited exactly once.

## Security Architecture

### Secure Payload Transmission

A random stranger's phone is carrying your transaction. How do you stop them from reading the amount or changing it?

**Solution: Hybrid encryption (RSA-OAEP + AES-GCM).**

The sender encrypts the payload with the server's public key. Only the server holds the private key, so intermediates see opaque ciphertext.

But RSA can only encrypt small data (~245 bytes for a 2048-bit key), and our payload is JSON that could exceed that. So we use the standard hybrid pattern:

1. Generate a fresh AES-256 key for *this packet*.
2. Encrypt the JSON with **AES-256-GCM** (fast + authenticated).
3. Encrypt just the AES key with **RSA-OAEP**.
4. Concatenate: `[256 bytes RSA-encrypted AES key][12 bytes IV][AES ciphertext + 16-byte GCM tag]`.

**Why GCM specifically?** It's authenticated encryption. If an intermediate flips one bit anywhere in the ciphertext, decryption throws an exception — the GCM tag won't verify. The server cannot be tricked into processing tampered data.

This is the same scheme TLS uses. See `HybridCryptoService.java`.

### Idempotent Transaction Processing

Three bridge nodes hold the same packet. They all walk outside at the same instant. They all POST to `/api/bridge/ingest` within milliseconds of each other. If you naively process all three, the sender is debited ₹1500 instead of ₹500.

**Solution: Atomic compare-and-set on the ciphertext hash.**

The very first thing the server does on receiving a packet is compute `SHA-256(ciphertext)` and try to "claim" that hash:

```java
// IdempotencyService.java
Instant prev = seen.putIfAbsent(packetHash, now);
return prev == null;  // true = first claimer, false = duplicate
```

`ConcurrentHashMap.putIfAbsent` is atomic. Even if 100 threads call it at the exact same nanosecond, exactly one returns `null` (the first claimer) and the rest return the existing entry. Only the first claimer proceeds to decrypt and settle. The rest are short-circuited as `DUPLICATE_DROPPED`.

**Why hash the ciphertext, not the packetId or the cleartext?**
- `packetId` can be rewritten by a malicious intermediate. Two copies of the same payment could have different packetIds. Bad key.
- The cleartext requires decryption first. We want to dedupe *before* spending CPU on RSA.
- The ciphertext is authenticated by GCM, so any tampering is detectable on decrypt. Two legitimate deliveries of the same payment have byte-identical ciphertexts (AES is deterministic for a given key+IV+plaintext, and the same packet means the same key+IV+plaintext).

In production this `ConcurrentHashMap` becomes Redis: `SET key NX EX 86400`. Same semantics, distributed across replicas.

There's also a defense-in-depth fallback: `transactions.packet_hash` has a unique index. If the cache layer ever fails and two settlements somehow try to write the same hash, the database rejects the second one.

### Replay Attack Protection

An attacker who captured a ciphertext weeks ago could replay it whenever convenient.

**Solution: Two layers.**

1. **Inside the encrypted payload**, the sender includes `signedAt` (epoch millis). The server rejects any packet older than 24 hours. The attacker can't change `signedAt` without breaking the GCM tag.
2. **Inside the encrypted payload**, the sender includes a **nonce** (UUID). Even if Alice legitimately sends Bob ₹100 twice, the nonces differ → ciphertexts differ → hashes differ → both settle. But a *replay* of one specific signed packet is byte-identical, so the idempotency cache catches it.

See `BridgeIngestionService.java` for the freshness check.

Content-Type: application/json
X-Bridge-Node-Id: phone-bridge-42
X-Hop-Count: 3

{
  "packetId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",

}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "outcome": "SETTLED",                     // or "DUPLICATE_DROPPED" or "INVALID"
  "packetHash": "a3f8c9...",
  "reason": null,                            // populated on INVALID
  "transactionId": 42                        // populated on SETTLED
}
```

---

## Testing

Run all tests:
```
mvnw.cmd test
```

The three included tests:

- **`encryptDecryptRoundTrip`** — sanity-check that hybrid encryption is symmetric.
- **`tamperedCiphertextIsRejected`** — flip a byte in the ciphertext, verify that `BridgeIngestionService` returns `INVALID` instead of crashing or settling.
- **`singlePacketDeliveredByThreeBridgesSettlesExactlyOnce`** — the headline test. Three threads, one packet, simultaneous delivery. Asserts exactly one `SETTLED`, two `DUPLICATE_DROPPED`, and that the sender's balance changed by exactly the amount once.

---

## Deployment Considerations

For production deployment, the following enhancements are recommended:

- PostgreSQL or MySQL as the primary datastore
- Redis-backed distributed idempotency cache
- HSM or cloud KMS managed cryptographic keys
- Mutual TLS between bridge nodes and backend services
- Distributed monitoring and observability
- Transaction rate limiting and fraud detection

This implementation demonstrates a secure architecture for offline transaction routing, packet deduplication, and deferred settlement processing.

| Current Implementation | Production Deployment |
|---|---|
| H2 in-memory DB | PostgreSQL / MySQL with replicas |
| `ConcurrentHashMap` for idempotency | Redis with `SET NX EX` |
| RSA keypair regenerated on every startup | Private key in HSM (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault). Public key cached on devices. |
| Server-side `PaymentOrchestrationService<br/>.createPacket()` | Same code running on Android, in a Kotlin port |
| Software-simulated mesh (`MeshSimulatorService`) | Real BLE GATT or Wi-Fi Direct between phones |
| One settlement service that owns the ledger | Integration with NPCI / a real bank core |
| No auth on `/api/bridge/ingest` | Mutual TLS or signed bridge-node certificates |
| In-memory accounts seeded on startup | Real KYC'd users, real VPAs, real PIN verification against the bank |
| H2 console exposed | Disabled |
| No rate limiting | Per-bridge-node rate limit, per-sender velocity check |
| Logs to console | Structured logs to a SIEM, alerts on `INVALID` spikes |

The cryptography and idempotency code is essentially production-shaped. The infrastructure around it is what changes.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Android-based Bluetooth mesh implementation
- Wi-Fi Direct transport support
- Redis-backed distributed idempotency layer
- NPCI-compatible settlement integration
- Multi-region deployment support
- Advanced fraud detection rules
- Real-time transaction analytics dashboard

---

## Troubleshooting

**`java: command not found`** — Install JDK 17+. On Windows, `winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.17.JDK` or download from adoptium.net.

**Port 8080 already in use** — Change `server.port` in `application.properties`.

**First `mvnw.cmd` run hangs for a long time** — It's downloading Maven (~10 MB) then dependencies (~80 MB). Give it 2–3 minutes on a normal connection. After that, startup is ~5 seconds.

**`mvnw.cmd : The term 'mvnw.cmd' is not recognized`** — On PowerShell you need to prefix with `.\`: `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`.

**Tests fail intermittently** — The concurrency test is timing-sensitive. If it ever flakes, run it 3x; if it consistently fails on your hardware, file the actual failure output.
